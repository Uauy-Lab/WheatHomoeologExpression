# WheatHomoeologExpression
Methods for Transcriptome paper. 

This repository contains the code as used for the following sections:

1. Prepare TPM Table 
    * Expressed genes within the Azhurnaya developmental time course (209 samples) and Chinese Spring no stress (123 samples).
2. Calculate triad category
    *  Relative expression levels of the A, B, and D genome homoeologs across triads
    *  Definition of homoeolog expression bias categories
3.  Classify genes by movement
    * Variation in homoeolog expression bias across tissues (Stable/Dynamic triads)
